By the end of last Week I have a working dungeon generator using cellular automata.

Test results:
best options in CA generator:
Fill percent: 60
It√©rations: 4
width/height 64

TODO now:
1) figure out what meshes to use in cellular automata dungeon.
2) test if marching squares could be used to find unique shapes drawn by CA and fit unique congruent meshes there.

Problems to solve:
1) Coupling issue between A* and CAGenerator. exposing internal A* state is not a good idea, better to create a facade Inside the PathfindingSystem

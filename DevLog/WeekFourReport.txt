TODO:

	-Plan maximum: get game ready for the first play test:
		- Implement basic combat AI
		- Increase party limit to 4, and ensure the party can move
		- Make starting location
		- Make player characters interact with environment

log one(tuesday - 1/7/25): scripts that are responsible for scene change are ready. now i have:
	- intro script with simple UI to go to debug sc√®nes
	- scene for BSP trees debugging and tests
	- scene for CA generator tests
	- scene for AI testing

at this point i suddenly realised that i can implement Behavours Tree or utility ai or any other ai system only after i implement the combat scripts
and for combat scripts i have to finalize the classes in game, and adjust the lore. at least a basic class system. and decide on the basic spells, and rotations. so now i commit and change the plan.
